<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 33 years old, from the deep south about an hour from New Orleans.  I'm a little quirky, but usually pretty quiet and I keep to myself.  
  I have two degrees, both in business, and I'm a civil law notary.  
  I have a partner of 7 years, who helps me to stay focused on my goals - and sane. 
  I work in the court system, but I'm looking to break into web development so I can flex my creative muscles.</p>
